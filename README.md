# EVO-Draft
Makes EVO fantasy drafts easier

I started building this project to help my friends and I make a fantasy draft for Super Smash Bros. Melee at EVO 2015, a gigantic fighting game tournament. Unfortunately I think development on this project is going to halt since I ran into some roadblocks with how EVO stores its brackets online that make it very difficult to scrape. I will be fixing this up before future tournaments such as TBH5 this year, though.

Uses Scrapy or Challonge to pull tournament data, then computes how many points each individual player has won so far.
